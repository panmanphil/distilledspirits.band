We are kicking of the season with a bang. You may have attended last year's Heidi Burson solo house concert and been blown away by her vocal talent like we were. Well, this year she's back and with her band. If you heard her last year you'll want to hear her again and if you missed last year concert now's your chance to experience Heidi's incredible voice.

HEIDI BURSON’S story as an artist is one of shared human experience. Very early on, she felt the poignancy of the music of the great soul singers who came before her like Etta James and Aretha Franklin. She was struck by the power and intensity with which they expressed the longing, which we all share, for love and acceptance. These influences, coupled with her own life experiences and a generous dusting of wry humor, have helped to forge a voice and style that is uniquely fascinating.  Her delivery is captivating.  When Heidi sings, people listen. 

To date, Heidi is an award-winning artist and songwriter and has released 2 self-produced full-length albums, Every Shade of Blue in 2012 and The Story in 2017 which features a powerful 12-piece band. You might hear Heidi’s music on AcmeRadioLive and Lightning 100 in Nashville as well as many other independent radio stations across the US and even as far as Berlin.  Her single, "Give Your Love Away" has been featured on BBC Radio.  She has received song placements on UK playlists for various businesses and future placements on TV and film are about to take flight.   Not only has she secured bookings from the east to the west coast, but in true indie/unsigned artist style she has successfully produced two full summer tours throughout the UK and Europe.  Her touring has seen her perform in various festivals, concert series and notable venues such as the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, the 100 Club in London and Ruine Senftenburg Castle in Austria.   

With relentless drive and some milestone career goals now achieved, Heidi hopes to continue reaching across the world to connect people to each other with the love of good music.  As an independent artist with something relevant to say and a better understanding of how to navigate the music industry on her own terms, there is much still yet to come from this one in the years ahead.
