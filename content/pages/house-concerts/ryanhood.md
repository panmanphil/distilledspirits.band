It is time to welcome back one of our favorites after the long pandemic break. Ryanhood has been with us from the start, playing every year we had concerts. The combine a high acoustic flavored energy with a great warmth, a great level of panache, and with moments of tenderness and of fireworks. 

For those that haven't seen them, they are an acoustic duo with all original music and a variety of instruments. It's really fun to hear all they can get out of a duo! This time around they have been on a tear of new writing, of revisiting older songs, of having done a Patreon show every Sunday for what seems like forever.

We do expect to be outdoors where we can seat more people. This will be a high energy concert too, full band and all. So, we do expect this to fill up pretty quickly, let us know if you can make it with the rsvp below
