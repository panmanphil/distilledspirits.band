There is lots more information about this group on the [Sundae & Mr. Goessl official website](http://sundaeandmrgoessl.com/)

The husband and wife (Kate Voss and Jason Goessl) duo puts on a vintage inspired show that blends blues, swing, country and latin sounds. Performing hits from the roaring 20's to modern classics and originals Sundae + Mr. Goessl utilize technique, technology and unique instrumentation to give this little band it's big band sound. Mr. Goessl's mesmorizing finger-style guitar dazzles and inspires while Sundae's sultry vocal interpretations drip with charm and nostalgia.
 Kate hails from Seattle, while Jason is a Wisconsin native. They call Seattle home when they're not touring the country. We've had the opportunity to get to know Kate and Jason over the past few years when they've stayed with us while out on tour so we're particularly excited to bring their talent to our audience.

### Kate Voss named Vocalist of the Year in 2018 by Seattle Weekly
### Sundae and Mr. Goessl named Best Jazz Act in 2017 by Seattle Weekly
