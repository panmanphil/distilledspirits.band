We first heard Nicholas Raymond opening for The Lone Bellow at the Meyer Theatre maybe five years ago. The room was packed, everybody had come to see the main act and Nick walks out, just him and his guitar. And killed it! People were amazed. A local musician, we've followed him though his time with a popular rock band, The Traveling Suitcase, through some life and music changes, and now to a renewed focus on solo and duo work in the last couple of years. The songwriting is great, as a performer, well you have to see it!
