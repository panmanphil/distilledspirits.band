Woody Mankowski was one of the most sought after musicians in Wisconsin. Starting from the days when he and I (Philip) started working together in the late '80's, to the studio, and to when he joined Big Mouth in the mid '90's. You may have seen him playing R&B, blues, jazz, really almost anything. Both singing and playing the sax, he is just amazing. High energy, meticulous, soaring, so many words you could use to describe him and his music. Woody moved to Los Angeles in 2015 and other than an occasional trip back each year in the summer, has been great music and growing his reputation there too. This will be fun!

Joining him will be the Greg Koch trio. We haven't seen much of Greg here in Northeast Wisconsin. He's from Milwaukee and I've heard him described as the best guitarist in the world you've never heard of. He's one of those guys you listen to and say, "I could practice my whole life and never be able to play as well as he plays". There is a good bit of background of him and plenty of samples of what he does at his website

We do expect to be outdoors where we can seat more people. This will be a high energy concert too, full band and all. So, we do expect this to fill up pretty quickly, let us know if you can make it with the rsvp below
